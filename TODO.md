# TODO

* refactor style coaching page to be a custom page/route, see also [gatsby routes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/routing/#creating-routes)
* figure out what's up with embedded videos and IG, use a plugin?
* make /blog route
* make home show a limit of 3 posts (pagecontext.limit), but more on /blog and pagination
